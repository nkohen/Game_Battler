# Game_Battler
I created this game as my Data Structures final project. I had just gotten my wisdom teeth out and clearly had a lot of time to spend on it. For a full description of the game, how to extend it, and technical details including the implementation of the AI, [look here](https://github.com/nkohen/Game_Battler/blob/master/DSHW5.pdf).

I envisioned this game as kind of a minigame that should be embedded into some larger game so initializing this game is quite clunky right now.

I also saw this project as more of a framework where I defined two types of Fighter objects so that the game could be tested and played but if I were to make this a fun game, I would make more types and attempt to balance their moves so that this game would be more enjoyable than it is right now.
